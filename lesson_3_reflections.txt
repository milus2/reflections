What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
 like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
 
 Pros: 
 You can choose the most appropriate, logical, point at whichh to make a commit.
 You can keep the changes small and manageable between commits.
 You can commit at a point where a piece of work is complete rather than half way through.
 
 Cons:
 May result in too many intermediate commits.
 Won't be done logically.
 May be too lon or too short between commits.
 
 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 
 git log provides a list of all the commits that have previously been made in the 
 repository. Each commit has a uniique hash that identifies that commit. In order to compaare the changes between two 
 versions you need ot use the command git diff then the hash for the first commit and then the hash for the second commit.
 
 This provides a list of changes betwee nthe two versions
 
 
 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
 since one can revert back and check for changes that cause problems easily version control 
 allows ne to make changes without worrying about it too much as it allows you to  pinpoint 
 when and which change introduced the problem and easily identify it.
