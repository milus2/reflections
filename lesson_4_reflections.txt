Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
 while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 Git version control is designed for programmers who need to be able to track changes across multiple 
 files whrer as google docs is designed for working with a document in a linear fashion in isolation so only needs to be able to revert back 
 to a previous instance of just that file and is unrelated to other documents as the yare not tracked.
